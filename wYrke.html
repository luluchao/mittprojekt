    <p> Pirate Warrior is very controversial because it has the ability to kill opponent’s very quickly and many view unfairly. This deck, however, can run out of steam  and can be hurt with tech cards such as Golakka Crawler and Weapon removal like Acidic Swamp Ooze, Gluttonous Ooze, or Harrison Jones. One of the big weaknesses of this deck is that it contains no card draw, so if it draws a slow hand or a handful of weapons it can just lose on the spot.  </p>
        
    <p>The deck took a pretty big hit with the nerf to Fiery War Axe, but Prince Keleseth seemed to soften the blow. Pirate Warrior isn’t as strong as it once was, but with the addition of some new tools in Kobolds and Catacombs it might be in a better spot than it was in the Frozen Throne meta.</p>
